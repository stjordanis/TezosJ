# TezosJ library

The **TezosJ library** enables Java and Android developers to create apps that communicates with Tezos blockchain.

The library is written in Java and is based on Android framework. This repository contains the library as well as a demo application demonstrating how to use it.

The main purpose of TezosJ Integration Library is to foster development of applications in Java / Android that interacts
with Tezos ecosystem. This might open Tezos to a whole world of software producers, ready to collaborate with the platform.
TezosJ is to play the role of a layer that will translate default Java method calls to Tezos's network real operations
(create_account, transfer_token, etc.).
