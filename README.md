The main purpose of TezosJ Integration Library is to foster development of applications in Java / Android that interacts
with Tezos ecosystem. This might open Tezos to a whole world of software producers, ready to collaborate with the platform.
TezosJ is to play the role of a layer that will translate default Java method calls to Tezos's network real operations
(create_account, transfer_token, etc.).
